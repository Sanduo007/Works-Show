## 2. Pose estimation for UAV landing 

The idea of this work is to fuse the UAV pose retrieved by detecting the landing marker with the MEMS IMU data to achieve precision, continuous and high rate positioning for UAV landing.
The pose errors of the proposed system in one test are shown in following figures.

## 3. Express UAV 

The drone was designed for freighting which could automatically takeoff and fly to the destination by GNSS/INS positioning with obstacle avoidance by ultrasonic sensors, and then land on the pad by detecting the previously placed marker through an onboard camera. The video shows the key technologies.

## 4. Some competetion awards
4.1 **First prize** and  **"Best Paper Award"** in the 14th China Graduate Electronic Design Competition (*based on the work of Collaborative Precision Positioning and Navigation System of Robot*) (Aug.2019)

In this work, we built an autonomous driving. The self-developed GNSS/MEMS IMU module was used to obtain real-time localization results, lidar to detect obstacles, camera to detect the laneline and aid the INS and odometer was also used to provide velocity observation to correct INS error. The arpngicial potential field method was intrioduced for path planning.

## 5. SLAM Learning

An accurate and reliable navigation system is essential for an autonomous vehicle to operate effectively and safely. It is difficult, if not impossible, to realize precision self-localization for ground vehicles in various scenarios by using a single type or two types sensor. Thus, multisensor(>2) fusion navigation seems of great significance for this challenging application. The vision based simutaneous localization and mapping system has attracted huge interests in both academic and industial community (e.g. Waymo and Tesla) due to its low-cost and ability to percept the environment around the vehicle.  
<br/>
I believe it is an interesting and exciting direction to research multisensor fusion navigation for mobile robots. Although abundant related works have been proposed and many problems have been solved well, challengies are existed such as building and reusing long-term map, V-SLAM (VI-SLAM) in large scale area, indoor and outdoor continuous decimeter-level positioningand and so on. Following are some materials summarized by myself when learning V-SLAM.
