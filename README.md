This repository is about his research works in his master years. If you are interesting in anything of or have any question about it, please feel free to contact him <ybwu@whu.edu.cn>. 

## 1. Wheel-INS 
The experiments were carried out using a self-build wheel robot which was controled by a smartphone through WiFi.

## 2. Pose estimation for UAV landing 

The idea for this work is to fuse the UAV pose retrieved by detecting the landing marker with the MEMS IMU data to achieve precision and continuous positioning for UAV landing.
The positioning and attitude error of the proposed system in one test.

## 3. Express UAV 

The drone was designed for freighting which could takeoff automatically and fly to the destination by GNSS/INS positioning with obstacle avoidance by ultrasonic, and then land on the pad by detecting the previously placed marker through an onboard camera.

## 4. Some competetion awards
**First prize** and  **"Best Paper Award"** in the 14th China Graduate Electronic Design Competition (*based on the work of Collaborative Precision Positioning and Navigation System of Robot*)(Aug.2019)

In this work, we built an autonomous driving. The self-developed GNSS/MEMS IMU module was used to obtain real-time localization results, lidar to detect obstacles, camera to detect the laneline and aid the INS and odometer was also used to provide velocity observation to correct INS error. The artificial potential field method was intrioduced for path planning.
